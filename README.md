# JCU's Indigenous Winter School - Engineering and IT

# Build a Website for My Project

First, let's gather your content...

Using your 3-panel storyboard as a background, answer each question below. The actions from this step will give you the base content for your site.

## Problem area:
Describe the problem that you need to solve... probably what led you to deciding to do this.

Also write one overall question using the _How Might We_ format:  

Example: 
> How might we use motion and light data to make it easier to walk around the house at night so that we are safer?

## Problem solution:
Describe how your sensor kit solves your problem. Your answer should be a few sentences long.

## Why do we need to solve this problem?
Describe what the real meaningful value of this solution is. What's important or exciting about it?


# Now, let's create a website using wix.com

Go to http://wix.com and click the **Get Started** button

Click the **Sign Up** button

Enter your email address and type a new password. This will be your username and password on the Wix site.

Skip the Let’s Get Started. (Skip is in the bottom right corner)

Click the **Choose a template** button on the right side

Click **Blank Templates** on the left side

Choose whatever template you like the look of – e.g. Hover over the Strip Header layout and click the **Edit** button

Click the **X** on the popup video to close it

Double-click on the "NAME OF SITE" heading to edit the text and give it the name of your website

Click the Change Strip background and choose a suitable new background image 

You can click on any of the items on the page to make them bigger or smaller or to move them around

Now put your text about the project on the page in what you think is a meaningful way to tell your story

To create a new textbox, click on an existing textbox and click the duplicate icon in the toolbox (should be at the right of your page). It will lay it on top of the original textbox. Drag it to where you would like it to be.

If you’d like to delete something, just click on it, and hit the delete key. If you accidentally delete something that you want back, click Ctrl + Z for undo.

To add something to your site, click the **+ Add** button on the left menu and choose the item from the list. For example, if you want to add an image, click on the image link. You will have a choice of where to locate your image. You can get it from online, or you can upload an image yourself. 

Add your storyboard sketch.

To _add your live data_, open a separate browser tab and go to the ThingSpeak site, https://thingspeak.com 

You may need to login to find your own channel, but you should find a URL something like: https://thingspeak.com/channels/815047

(For each chart)  
Find the chart for the sensor you want to embed and click the popout button
You will see your chart on its own page

Copy the url, which will be something like: https://thingspeak.com/channels/815047/charts/1?bgcolor=%23ffffff&color=%23d62020&dynamic=true&results=60&type=line&update=15

Go back to your Wix site

Click the **+** button in the menu

Click the **More** button, then **Embeds**, then **Embed a Site**

Click to enter the site URL then paste the URL you copied from ThingSpeak and click **Apply**.

Add some more content to the page to explain your charts. 

Feel free to customise the site, add a selfie of your team with your sensor kit. Brag. Tell where you’re from.

When you’re done click the publish button! You are now on the Internet. :)
